# Fraud-Detection
Credit Card Fraud Detection Project Using Machine Learning Models Trained on PCA Applied Real Data
Kaggel Dataset Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection

Intro:
This project focuses on identifying fraudulent transactions using a dataset from Kaggle. The dataset includes credit card transactions performed by European cardholders in September 2013. We will preprocess the dataset to some degree as it is highly unbalanced; then, we will use Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Artificial Neural Networks to train on the preprocessed data tuning using hyperparameters to find an optimal model that would generalize fairly enough.
